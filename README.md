# Sample Data Analysis

Here is some sample data analysis, originally created as an example for foring with the [jupyter-power-container](https://github.com/aogriffiths/jupyter-power-container), but should work on any jupyter notebook server.

You can see the examples without downloading or running them, just click on the `.ipynb` notebooks above and github will render them nicely!

The sample data file is `Gender Pay Gap.csv`. It's the 2017-2018 file downloaded 7 June 2018 from [here]( https://gender-pay-gap.service.gov.uk/viewing/download).

Each notebook is numbered, roughly in an order you might be interested in them, but you can look at or run any notebook in any order.
